But there&rsquo;s another group we need to engage: the sponsors.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Sponsors are what make this conference possible. PyCon wouldn&rsquo;t be possible without their support. From low ticket prices to financial aid, to video recording, the organizations who step forward to support PyCon, in turn support the entire Python community. They make it possible for so many to attend, for so many to be presenters, and for the world at home to watch along.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Along with the benefits sponsorship gives the conference and the community, we offer an excellent set of benefits to our sponsors.</p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n\t<li>See our full proposals: <a href=\"https://us.pycon.org/2018/sponsors/prospectus/\">https://www.pycon.lt/2018/sponsors/prosals</a></li>\r\n\t<li>Fill out the application: <a href=\"https://us.pycon.org/2018/sponsors/prospectus/\">https://www.pycon.lt/2018/sponsors/apply</a></li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<h2>Recruiting</h2>\r\n\r\n<p>What better place to find Python developers than a gathering of 200 of them? If you&rsquo;re hiring, PyConLT is the place to be.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The conference has long been a great way to find the talented developers so many companies are searching for. Many companies receive hundreds of resumes during the 3 hour event.</p>\r\n\r\n<h2>Marketing</h2>\r\n\r\n<p>Getting your name and product out there through the promotional aspects of our sponsorship packages is a great competitive advantage. If your business is built on Python, you&#39;ll want to be part of the biggest and most prestigious Python conference in Baltic states. You&#39;ll have the opportunity to be matched with those who could potentially become clients or employees and to stay in front of your current customers.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Given PyConLT&rsquo;s size and importance in the yearly conference calendar, people look to the sponsors to see who is using and supporting Python. A big part of participating is building relationships with the Python community. Sponsoring companies are the ones that attendees want to buy from and work for.</p>\r\n\r\n<h2>Audience</h2>\r\n\r\n<p>PyConLT&rsquo;s attracts from beginners to experts, PyConLT draws attendees from those with zero experience all the way through a significant group of the contributors to the language itself.</p>\r\n\r\n<h2>Competitive Pricing</h2>\r\n\r\n<p>When you consider the cost of conference passes that all packages include, we think you&#39;ll find great value in each PyCon sponsorship package.</p>\r\n\r\n<h2>Flexibility</h2>\r\n\r\n<p>We want to help you construct a sponsorship package that fits your needs. If a small booth would work better than a large one, perhaps we can swap it in exchange for another benefit that works better for your organization. For some organizations, a booth is not practical at all, but adding another conference pass may work better. We&#39;re happy to customize a sponsorship package to give you the freedom to choose what you think works best in order to meet your event participation goals.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>If you have any questions
